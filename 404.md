# HTTP status 404

The 404 HTTP status code, Not Found, is returned by the server when you try to
access a resource that does not exist, or under rare circumstances, due to
another server error.

This is probably happening because:

* You clicked on a link that doesn't exist on tirimid.net anymore
* You typed the web address incorrectly and tried to acces a page that never
  existed on tirimid.net
* You tried to access a page which has moved locations in the website's
  directory tree

=About me

    Hello, I'm tirimid (sometimes Tirimid or polytopelover) and this is my
personal website for publishing things I make. Obviously not everything I've
ever made will be present here, so this is not a definitive catalog of my
works.
    If you need to contact me for some reason, you can send an email to
tirimid@tirimid.net. I usually check this mailbox at least once a day, but do
not expect an immediate response.

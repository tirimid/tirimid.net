Hello, I'm tirimid (sometimes Tirimid or polytopelover) and this is my personal
website for publishing things I make - which means essays, guides,
documentation, and so on. Whenever I create something that I want to put out
into the world for others to see, I will probably create a page about it on this
site. Obviously not everything I've ever made is something I'm comfortable with
uploading here, so this is not a definitive catalog of my works.

I am strongly in favor of free software, privacy, and security. The source code
to this website is available at [its GitHub](https://github.com/tirimid/tirimid.net).

If you need to contact me for some reason, you can send an email to
tirimid@tirimid.net. I usually check this mailbox at least once a day, but do
not expect an immediate response.

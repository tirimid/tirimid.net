<p><i>This page is for the use of myself and friends. The presented information
will not be useful without prior context about our studies.</i></p>

 capital city of Port-au-Prince</li>
<li>More than 54 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had occurred</li>
<li>Estimated 3 mln. people affected by the quake</li>
<li>Death toll estimates vary wildly, from 100,000 to 316,000 (the latter being an
 official upper bound figure)</li>
<li>One of the main causes of death were the traditionally heavy roofs that people
 built houses with collapsing</li>
<li>Government estimated that 250,000 residences were destroyed</li>
<li>Aid was sent in by many countries, including the USA</li>
<li>US companies were contracted to rebuild destroyed Haitian infrastructure, but
 they did a very poor job, even leaving the main parliament building unfinished</li>

<h2>2018 Sunda Strait tsunami</h2>
<ul>
<li>On 22 December, 2018, the southwestern side of Anak Krakatoa, Indonesia,
 collapsed into its caldera, causing a landslide, which itself caused a tsunami</li>

<h1>Option E &mdash; Sports, Leisure, Tourism</h1>
<h2>Example of horizontal integration in TNCs</h2>

 Airlines</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>EasyJet Holidays handles transport, accommodation, planning, etc. all at the
 same time</li>
</ul>
<h2>Niche markets example</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deep Sea Freediving is a niche of Deep sea diving, which is a niche of Diving</li>
</ul>
<h2>Role of TNCs in tourism</h2>
<ul>
<li>In 2023, tourism accounted for $9.5 trln. US of the global GDP</li>
<li>In Spain, 150,000+ protestors from 40+ cities (including Madrid) have opposed

 mass-manufacture in 1964)</li>
</ul>
<h2>South Africa World Cup 2010</h2>
<ul>
<li>Used 10x the money to host the world cup that they spent on fighting HIV that
 year</li>

 tourism continued at similar increased rates</li>
<li>Local stores mostly did not benefit from increased tourism because the
 government did not let tourists visit them</li>

 Kolkata (14 mln.), Bangalore (8 mln.)</li>

 making cities with large younger populations (like Bangalore, Hyderabad, and

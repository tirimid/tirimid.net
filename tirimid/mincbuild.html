<h1>What is mincbuild?</h1>
<p>Mincbuild, which stands for (Min)imalist (C) (Build)system, is a buildsystem
designed to make project build easier for other minimalist C(++) software. Now,
you may be worried that this is just like all the other buildsystems, and it has
some shitty DSL that was designed by a group of crackheads rolling dice to
decide on fundamental features, but no! The only piece of necessary
configuration is a single conf file that describes the basics of how your
project should be built.</p>
<p>Of course, with no buildsystem DSL, mincbuild is meaningfully more
restrictive than other buildsystems. For example, you cannot build one set of
files using one command, and another set of files using another command without
setting up multiple configurations, but given that the target usage for
mincbuild is other minimalist software which shouldn&apos;t really be doing this
anyway, that&apos;s not really an issue.</p>
<p>As of writing this, mincbuild is only 1073 lines of C code, and the
resulting binary from the build is 44KB in size.</p>
<p>If your software is so minimalist (or designed in such a way) that the
entire source implementation fits in one file, you are better off using
something like Make, because mincbuild (while it will also work for this
use-case) is meant specifically for minimalist software implemented across
multiple source files, allowing for incremental compilation.</p>
<h1>Installation and setup</h1>
<p>First, clone the repository from <a href="https://github.com/tirimid/mincbuild">the GitHub</a>
using:</p>
<div class="long-code">$ git clone https://github.com/tirimid/mincbuild
$ cd mincbuild</div>
<p>Then, build the program. On Linux, this is a very simple process - mincbuild
is designed for it. I have also had success with building mincbuild on Windows
through MinGW, but it can be a trivial bit more involved.</p>
<p>To build on Linux, run:</p>
<div class="long-code">$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./mincbuild</div>
<p>To build on MinGW:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <code>bootstrap.sh</code> in an editor (probably GNU nano)</li>
<li>Remove <code>-lpthread</code> from <code>LIBS</code> (MinGW may not support pthread)</li>
<li>Add <code>-DPRUNE_SINGLE_THREAD -DCOMPILE_SINGLE_THREAD</code> to <code>CFLAGS</code></li>
<li>Exit your text editor</li>
<li>Run <code>./bootstrap.sh</code></li>
<li>If you get errors about how &quot;uint16 is undefined&quot; or something, you can do an
 evil - <i>evil</i> - (but working) hack where you just go into the file causing the
 error and insert a <code>typedef unsigned short uint16;</code>. You can also add an
 <code>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;</code> higher up if needed, but it probably shouldn&apos;t be.</li>
<li>Run <code>CFLAGS=&quot;-std=c99 -pedantic -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809 -D_GNU_SOURCE
 -DPRUNE_SINGLE_THREAD -DCOMPILE_SINGLE_THREAD&quot; ./mincbuild.exe</code></li>
</ol>
<p>You will notice upon the <code>mincbuild</code> binary that it prints build output with
an extremely simple progress bar. This is because I&apos;ve personally always hated
it when buildsystems or build processes in general don&apos;t give you even a vague
indication of how long is left until completion.</p>
<p>As another note - something worth knowing is that the whole
&quot;PRUNE_SINGLE_THREAD COMPILE_SINGLE_THREAD&quot; thing you do on MinGW will obviously
neuter multithreaded functionality. This sucks for general usage, but is
actually quite nice if you have specific compatibility requirements (I suppose
MinGW actually counts as one?).</p>
<p>Anyway - now, you can install mincbuild to your system. To do this, run:</p>
<div class="long-code"># ./install.sh</div>
<p>And if you ever want to remove mincbuild from your system, run:</p>
<div class="long-code"># ./uninstall.sh</div>
<h1>Using mincbuild</h1>
<p>First, to use mincbuild for a project, your project must follow a set,
simple directory structure:</p>
<div class="long-code">project/
    source-files/
        file.c
        file.c
        ...
    header-files/
        file.h
        file.h
        ...
    mincbuild.conf</div>
<p>Obviously, the names of the files / directories involved can be changed,
they have just been named descriptively here for ease of understanding. The main
thing here is that this directory <i>structure</i> is set in stone. Technically you
can just use a single source directory for everything and mincbuild will allow
it, but by design, mincbuild is meant for the structure outlined above. The
rationale behind this is that it enforces a consistent project organization
which is common and easy to understand. Anyway, that part is fairly obvious and
requires no further elaboration - the interesting thing is the <code>mincbuild.conf</code>.</p>
<p>The mincbuild conf takes the form of <code>key = value</code> configuration pairs
(notice the significant whitespace between the <code>key</code>, <code>=</code>, and <code>value</code>).
Comments begin with a <code>#</code>, as with most basic conf files - and only lines which
<i>begin</i> with a <code>#</code> (not including leading whitespace) will be treated as a
comment. If a <code>#</code> comment appears at the end of an otherwise non-comment line,
it will not be treated as a comment.</p>
<h2>Simple compilation</h2>
<p>To begin with, there are a few keys that are absolutely essential to the
compilation phase of the build, and mincbuild will output an error if any of
these are missing. See below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cc</code>: Path to the compiler used for compilation</li>
<li><code>cflags</code>: Flags passed to the compiler upon invocation</li>
<li><code>src_dir</code>: Path to the project source directory</li>
<li><code>inc_dir</code>: Path to the project header directory</li>
<li><code>lib_dir</code>: Path to the project build directory where compiled object files will
 be placed</li>
<li><code>produce_output</code>: Boolean value determining whether linking should occur after
 the compilation phase of the build</li>
<li><code>src_exts</code>: Space-separated list of all file extensions used for source files
 within the project</li>
<li><code>hdr_exts</code>: Space-separated list of all file extensions used for header files
 within the project</li>
<li><code>incs</code>: Space-separated list of all directories that should be added to the
 include path besides the project include directory. Used for dependencies
 stored on the project source tree</li>
<li><code>cc_inc_fmt</code>: Determines how include paths will be passed to the compiler upon
 invocation. Should almost always be set to <code>-I%i</code></li>
<li><code>cc_cmd_fmt</code>: Determines how the compiler will be invoked. Should almost always
 be set to <code>%c %f -o %c -c %s %i</code></li>
<li><code>cc_success_rc</code>: Return code outputted by the compiler upon a successful
 compilation after being invoked. Should usually be set to <code>0</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A basic <code>mincbuild.conf</code> which contains all of these keys would look
something like this:</p>
<div class="long-code"># toolchain.
cc = /usr/bin/gcc
cflags = -std=c99 -pedantic

# project.
src_dir = src
inc_dir = include
lib_dir = lib
produce_output = false
src_exts = c
hdr_exts = h

# dependencies.
incs = NONE

# toolchain information.
cc_inc_fmt = -I%i
cc_cmd_fmt = %c %f -o %o -c %s %i
cc_success_rc = 0</div>
<p>... which will define a C project with a <code>src</code> source file directory, an
<code>include</code> header file directory, and a <code>lib</code> object file output directory.
Unlike <code>src</code> and <code>include</code>, <code>lib</code> does not need to exist before the build
process - and will be automatically created if it is missing. When mincbuild is
invoked here, all source files in <code>src</code> will be compiled to corresponding object
files in <code>lib</code>, but the build will stop at that. No linking will occur and you
will be left with <i>just</i> compiled object files - which is useful in the
situation that you want to link them individually into other projects.</p>
<p>Oh, and, by the way, in case you haven&apos;t noticed - the dummy name <code>NONE</code> is
used whenever a key should have an empty value, rather than just leaving it
blank. Another thing to keep in mind is that trailing significant whitespace
applies to the values of the configuration file: i.e. a value &quot;hello&quot; is
different to another value &quot;hello &quot; (notice the trailing space) but it is <i>not</i>
different to &quot; hello&quot; (notice the leading space). This is important to note
because if you meant to pass &quot;<code>NONE</code>&quot; as one of the values, but accidentally
passed &quot;<code>NONE </code>&quot; (with a trailing space), the behavior will not be the same in
both cases.</p>
<h2>Linking the project</h2>
<p>However, for most projects it won&apos;t be enough to simply compile all the
sources - you want to link them all together. In order to do this, you will need
to set <code>produce_output</code> to <code>true</code> and define the following keys, without which
the mincbuild linking phase cannot occur and an error will be outputted:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ld</code>: Path to the linker used for linking</li>
<li><code>ldflags</code>: Flags passed to the linker upon invocation</li>
<li><code>output</code>: Name of the output binary created upon linking</li>
<li><code>libs</code>: Space-separated list of all libraries that should be linked into the
 project</li>
<li><code>ld_lib_fmt</code>: Determines how libraries will be passed to the linker upon
 invocation. Should usually be set to <code>-l%l</code></li>
<li><code>ld_obj_fmt</code>: Determines how object files will be passed to the linker upon
 invocation. Should almost always be set to <code>%o</code></li>
<li><code>ld_cmd_fmt</code>: Determines how the linker will be invoked. Should almost always
 be set to <code>%c %f -o %b %o %l</code></li>
<li><code>ld_success_rc</code>: Return code outputted by the linker upon a successful linking
 after being invoked. Should usually be set to <code>0</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A basic <code>mincbuild.conf</code> which implements compilation and linking would look
something like:</p>
<div class="long-code"># toolchain.
cc = /usr/bin/gcc
ld = /usr/bin/gcc
cflags = -std=c99 -pedantic
ldflags = NONE

# project.
src_dir = src
inc_dir = include
lib_dir = lib
produce_output = true
output = demo
src_exts = c
hdr_exts = h

# dependencies.
incs = NONE
libs = NONE

# toolchain information.
cc_inc_fmt = -I%i
cc_cmd_fmt = %c %f -o %o -c %s %i
ld_lib_fmt = -l%l
ld_obj_fmt = %o
ld_cmd_fmt = %c %f -o %b %o %l
cc_success_rc = 0
ld_success_rc = 0</div>
<p>... which will define a C project with all the same properties as before,
except mincbuild will now also link the compiled object files into an output
binary called <code>demo</code>.</p>
<h2>Using the binary</h2>
<p>Finally, that&apos;s basically all you need to understand about the mincbuild
conf file and I can move on to the <code>mincbuild</code> command line tool you built
during the previous part of this guide. Using the <code>mincbuild</code> command line tool
is extremely simple. Just navigate to the project directory which contains the
<code>mincbuild.conf</code>, and run:</p>
<div class="long-code">$ mincbuild</div>
<p>Nice. Very simple. However, I said earlier that &quot;the names of the files /
directories [in the project] can be changed&quot;, and this includes the mincbuild
conf. This is true, you can rename it to anything. If you rename
<code>mincbuild.conf</code> to something else, say, <code>buildinfo.conf</code> or something, you will
need to run the following command instead:</p>
<div class="long-code">$ mincbuild buildinfo.conf</div>
<p>You may also pass some command line flags to mincbuild in the standard
<code>getopt()</code>-compatible format in order to change certain parts of the build
process in such a way that a successful build won&apos;t differ in any way than a
clean <code>mincbuild</code> invocation, but still provide some kind of useful
functionality. The possible flags are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-r</code>: The pruning phase of the build will be skipped and all files will be
 compiled. Even already built objects that don&apos;t strictly require rebuilding
 will be recompiled. This is useful in two main cases: a) if you change the
 <code>mincbuild.conf</code> and want to rebuild the project with the new settings, and b)
 if some part of your toolchain has changed in such a way that a full rebuild is
 necessary</li>
<li><code>-v</code>: Verbose output regarding the build process will be written to standard
 output. The progress messages that are normally outputted will also contain the
 commands invoked by mincbuild at that point in the build</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as the basic <code>-h</code> flag that everyone already understands.</p>
<h2>Temporary overrides</h2>
<p>The fact that the compiler, linker, compiler flags, linker flags, etc. are
hardcoded into the mincbuild conf is fine for most cases - especially if you&apos;ve
only tested your project on a single toolchain and cannot guarantee it building
on anything else.</p>
<p>However, let&apos;s say you have a program with a conditional compilation path
which enables UTF-8 support for text handling, and to enable this conditional
compilation path, you must compile with <code>-DENABLE_UTF_8_SUPPORT</code>. Well, it&apos;s
fine to make an edit to the conf file if you are an end user, but if you are a
programmer and need to frequently test your program both with <i>and</i> without
UTF-8, it certainly gets annoying to constantly make changes to a build file.</p>
<p>For this reason, mincbuild allows you to override specifically those
variables. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CC</code>: compiler</li>
<li><code>LD</code>: linker</li>
<li><code>CFLAGS</code>: compiler flags</li>
<li><code>LDFLAGS</code>: linker flags</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in our above example, you might do something like:</p>
<div class="long-code">$ CFLAGS=&quot;-DENABLE_UTF_8_SUPPORT&quot; mincbuild</div>
<p>... to build with UTF-8 support.</p>
<p>If the environment variable is not set, mincbuild will simply use the value
specified in the conf file.</p>
<p>As a hint, try running with <code>-v</code> to see that the command has actually
changed after an override, and make sure it is correct. You should also remember
that compiling different parts of the same project with different flags is often
ill-advised.</p>
<p>In fact, to be completely safe, you might want to run this instead:</p>
<div class="long-code">$ CFLAGS=&quot;-DENABLE_UTF_8_SUPPORT&quot; mincbuild -vr</div>
<p>You now understand everything there is to know about the basics of using
mincbuild.

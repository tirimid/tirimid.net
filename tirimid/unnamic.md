# Introduction

This is a conlang project. My rough "goal" in creating this is to make a more
phonologically and morphologically complex constructed language than I've done
in the past, and translate some things into it. This is mainly so that I have an
excuse to experiment with interesting (and maybe some unfamiliar) linguistic
features.

The name "Unnamic" is derived from the word "unnamed"; modified with the "-ic"
suffix and Proper-Noun'd with a capital "U". "Unnamic" is the English name for
the language, i.e. an exonym, and not the native name for it.

This page will serve as the official documentation for my conlang.

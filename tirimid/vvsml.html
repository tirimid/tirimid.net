<h1>What is VVSML... And why?</h1>
<p>So, you know Markdown and HTML, right? It&apos;s kind of like that. VVSML is a
markup language designed to build into a HTML file. If you want simplicity, use
Markdown. I didn&apos;t want simplicity: I wanted a programming-language-like syntax
based loosely on LaTeX, but without all the fuss involved in using LaTeX. Thus,
(V)ery (V)ery (S)imple (M)arkup (L)anguage was born. The question comes about,
then: &quot;why not just use HTML? It has a proglang-like syntax without the fuss of
LaTeX&quot;. Honestly, I just really dislike how HTML feels to write. Plus, HTML has
no dedicated features for conlanging - which I wanted.</p>
<h1>Using VVSML</h1>
<p>First; download, build, and install the VVSML program from <a href="https://github.com/tirimid/vvsml">the GitHub</a>.
You can do so using:</p>
<div class="long-code">$ git clone https://github.com/tirimid/vvsml
$ cd vvsml
$ cargo build --release
$ sudo cp target/release/vvsml /usr/bin</div>
<p>The actual <code>vvsml</code> binary takes two arguments. Run <code>vvsml</code> to see the
following:</p>
<div class="long-code">$ vvsml
error usage: <code>vvsml &lt;source file&gt; &lt;output file&gt;</code></div>
<p>The <code>source file</code> is meant to be the name of a VVSML source file, and
<code>output file</code> is meant to be the name of the file in which to output HTML code
generated using the VVSML source. If the given <code>output file</code> does not exist, it
should be created by the program. So, what are we waiting for? Let&apos;s get the
show on the road. Create a new file for VVSML source - I suggest using the
<code>.vvsml</code> extension for it. Then, open it in your text editor. Run:</p>
<div class="long-code">$ touch hello.vvsml
$ emacs -nw hello.vvsml</div>
<p>Below is some demo source code in VVSML:</p>
<div class="long-code">contents
{
    chapter {This is a very large heading}
    section {This is a large heading}
    subsection {This is a relatively small heading}
    text {This is a paragraph}
}</div>
<p>The LaTeX influence is obvious. Note that this can be laid out in many ways,
<code>vvsml</code> doesn&apos;t care if you place braces on the same line, a new line, if they
are touching the keyword, etc. Also, the whitespace in the above example is
arbitrary. VVSML is very relaxed with regard to formatting, but it cares
intensely about structure. To explain how <code>vvsml</code> handles code structure, we
have to understand two main types of substructure: &quot;layers&quot; and &quot;textual
extractors&quot;. A layer is a code element which contains sub-elements as a list -
in this example, the <code>contents</code> contains a <code>chapter</code>, a <code>section</code>, a
<code>subsection</code>, and a <code>text</code>; in that order. Each of those are textual extractors:
they do not and cannot contain other code elements. Instead, they contain
literal text as data. Flipwise, layers cannot contain textual data but they can
contain code elements (textual extractors and other layers). In fact, try adding
some random words into the <code>contents</code>, as follows:</p>
<div class="long-code">contents
{
    chapter {...}
    section {...}
    subsection {...}
    text {...}
    here is some random text outside of a textual extractor!
}</div>
<p>Then, try to build as follows:</p>
<div class="long-code">$ vvsml hello.vvsml out.html
error test.vvsml:7 - expected one of [chapter, section, subsection, text, list,
ordered list, table, block end], found other</div>
<p>See? It gives us a list of code elements which we can place inside the
<code>contents</code>. We cannot have textual data inside a layer. Awesome! We have a
nicely formatted markup file describing the contents of a document; what now?
Well, you now know pretty much everything necessary to write things using VVSML.
Now I will go over the more advanced layers, those you saw in the prior error
message. See the below code:</p>
<div class="long-code">contents
{
    list
    {
        subsection {first item in list}
        text {second item in list}
        chapter {third item in list}
        section {...}
    }
    ordered_list
    {
        subsection {first item in list}
        text {second item in list}
        chapter {third item in list}
        section {...}
    }
}</div>
<p>This is a demonstration of the <code>list</code> and <code>ordered_list</code> layers. They work
in effectively the same way: their child layers are displayed as lists when the
output HTML is viewed in a web browser. Both are actually ordered: the items are
displayed in the same order that they are written in the VVSML source. The only
difference between the two types of list is that <code>list</code> outputs a list which
uses dot or bullet points, while <code>ordered_list</code> outputs a list whose entries are
numbered starting from 1. That&apos;s it for the list layers. Now, see the following
<code>table</code> code:</p>
<div class="long-code">contents
{
    table
    {
        row
        {
            text {-}
            text {a}
            text {b}
            text {c}
        }
        row
        {
            text {1}
            text {a1}
            text {b1}
            text {c1}
        }
        row
        {
            text {2}
            text {a2}
            text {b2}
            text {c2}
        }
        row
        {
            text {3}
            text {a3}
            text {b3}
            text {c3}
        }
    }
}</div>
<p>A <code>table</code> can only contain one code element: the <code>row</code>. These <code>row</code>s,
however, can contain any layer or textual extractor. Since it&apos;s hard to put into
words, check out the cool table produced by the above code:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>-</td>
<td>a </td>
<td>b </td>
<td>c </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>a1</td>
<td>b1</td>
<td>c1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>a2</td>
<td>b2</td>
<td>c2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>a3</td>
<td>b3</td>
<td>c3</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>I hope that clears up any confusion. Anyway, it may be important to note
that each of these layers can be nested inside of each other. That is to say,
you can place a <code>list</code> inside of another <code>list</code>, or a <code>table</code> inside an
<code>ordered_list</code>, a <code>table</code> inside a <code>row</code>, and so on. A <code>row</code>, however, cannot
appear outside of a <code>table</code>. You now know all the core features of VVSML,
congratuations!</p>
<h1>Some of the crazier features</h1>
<p>Apart from the core features, <code>vvsml</code> also implements some convenient stuff
that I just thought would be kind of nice. First, character escapes. If you
wanted a &quot;}&quot; in a <code>text</code>, you wouldn&apos;t normally be able to add it - but with
escape characters, you can. To escape a character, add <code>]]$</code> in front of it. The
only characters that can be escaped are &quot;{&quot;, &quot;}&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;]&quot;. Trying to
escape anything else will cause <code>vvsml</code> to output an error.</p>
<p>That&apos;s nice, but it&apos;s not crazy. What is crazy is the preprocessor. In
VVSML, there are several &quot;preprocessor directives&quot; which can be placed in your
code to cause <code>vvsml</code> to do certain things before actually processing anything.
The first preprocessor directives to know are <code>.define_macro</code> and <code>macro</code>.</p>
<div class="long-code">.define_macro {name of macro} {value after expansion}
contents
{
    text {.macro {name of macro}}
}</div>
<p>This does exactly what you would expect. Note that all <code>.define_macro</code>s are
processed before any <code>.macro</code>s, so you can define them anywhere you want in the
file - they don&apos;t have to appear before their first usage in the file. After
macro expansion, the above code looks like this:</p>
<div class="long-code">
contents
{
    text {value after expansion}
}</div>
<p>Unlike the prior code elements, <code>.define_macro</code> takes two arguments instead
of just one. The first describes the name of a symbol in a symbol table, and the
second describes the value of that symbol. Note that the name of the symbol (and
the value) can be any valid UTF-8 string. Then, <code>.macro</code> does a lookup in the
symbol table using its argument, and replaces itself with the value if the
lookup is successful.</p>
<p>The next preprocessor directive is <code>.link</code>. <code>.link</code> takes a piece of text
and makes it into a clickable URL when its output is viewed in a browser. Like
<code>.define_macro</code>, it takes two arguments: the text of the link, and the
destination. See:</p>
<div class="long-code">contents
{
    text {the below link will send you to google.com:}
    text {.link {a link to google.com} {https://google.com/}}
}</div>
<p>Then: <code>.unicode</code>. This one takes a single argument, a unicode codepoint in
hexadecimal. See:</p>
<div class="long-code">contents
{
    subsection {the two texts below will output the same HTML}
    text {/.unicode {0068}.unicode {0065}.unicode {026a}/}
    text {/&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#618;/}
}</div>
<p>So that&apos;s pretty simple so far - nothing too wacky. The next few features
are either more complex or crazier. So then, regular expressions. If you want
the preprocessor to scan through your entire file and perform regex-replacements
on its text, VVSML gives you <code>.replace_all</code>. All written regex replacements are
done in the order they appear in the file - top down, left to right.
<code>.replace_all</code> takes two arguments: the regular expression to match against, and
the replacements. Note that the first argument can&apos;t really contain curly braces
since that would mess up <code>vvsml</code>&apos;s function. Check the below example:</p>
<div class="long-code">.replace_all {this is very [gb][oa][od]d?} {regular expressions...}
contents
{
    text {this is very good}
    text {this is very bad}
}</div>
<p>After preprocessing, this becomes:</p>
<div class="long-code">
contents
{
    text {regular expressions...}
    text {regular expressions...}
}</div>
<p>The next feature, <code>.format</code>, is much more involved. In the previous parts of
this... tutorial? you have seen many ways to format a written document -
different sized headers, URLs, lists, tables, etc. However, there is more to
formatting than just general layouts. For example, there is text weight and
minor positioning like sub / superscripting. This is where <code>.format</code> comes in.
<code>.format</code> takes two arguments: a string containing some textual data, and a
string describing how that text should be formatted. This &quot;description&quot; of the
formatting is done by writing certain format specifiers in the descriptor
string. See the text below defining each of the available format specifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>b</code>: The text should be made bold</li>
<li><code>i</code>: The text should be made italic</li>
<li><code>_</code>: The text should be subscripted</li>
<li><code>^</code>: The text should be superscripted</li>
<li><code>s</code>: The text should have a strikethrough</li>
<li><code>x</code>: The text should be treated as X-SAMPA text and be converted to IPA unicode
 characters</li>
<li><code>p</code>: The text should be treated as Praat text and be converted to IPA unicode
 characters</li>
<li><code>B</code>: The text should be treated as Branner text and be converted to IPA unicode
 characters</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be combined in any way to overlap their effects. See:</p>
<div class="long-code">contents
{
    text {.format {b} {bold}}
    text {.format {i} {italic}}
    text {.format {si_} {strikethrough, italic, and subscripted}}
    text {.format {b^} {bold and superscripted}}
    text {.format {x} {Eks sAmp@}}
}</div>
<p>I think this is a very nice demonstration of the <code>.format</code> preprocessor
directive. The last feature I want to talk about in this section is
<code>.external_table</code>. After seeing the above syntax for the <code>table</code> layer, you
probably thought: &quot;wow, this is inconvenient and I wish there was a nicer syntax
for it&quot;. Well, <code>vvsml</code> defines a separate syntax for tables which is easier and
much less unwieldy. In order to use it, create a new file to store this table -
I recommend the <code>.vvtab</code> file extension. Then, open this file in your text
editor:</p>
<div class="long-code">$ touch example.vvtab
$ emacs -nw example.vvtab</div>
<p>After opening this file, try writing the following code:</p>
<div class="long-code">- &amp; a  &amp; b  &amp; c  $
1 &amp; a1 &amp; b1 &amp; c1 $
2 &amp; a2 &amp; b2 &amp; c2 $
3 &amp; a3 &amp; b3 &amp; c3 $</div>
<p>Then, go back to <code>hello.vvsml</code> and write the following:</p>
<div class="long-code">contents
{
    .external_table {example.vvtab}
}</div>
<p><code>.external_table</code> takes one argument - the path of the file containing your
table. I call this special table syntax &quot;VVtab&quot;, a mixing of &quot;VVSML&quot; and
&quot;table&quot;. In VVtab, all table elements are assumed to be <code>text</code>s. Each item in a
row is seperated by a <code>&amp;</code>, and each row is seperated by a <code>$</code>. Again, the LaTeX
influence here is clearly visible. The fact that &quot;&amp;&quot; and &quot;$&quot; are pretty common
characters necessitates that VVtab introduce an escape character for being able
to write them without being interpreted as seperators. Simple: just place a &quot;&quot;
before them. Done and dusted. Note that the above table is equivalent to the one
described in the previous section.
